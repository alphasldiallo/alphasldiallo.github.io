<p>In this article, I am going to present what is a convex hull, what is its purpose and how can we construct it in Python. Then I enter into more details by defining an Alpha Shape and using Delaunay triangulation method to construct it.</p>

<p>Convex Hull.
The main idea behind a convex hull comes from the definition of a convex polygon. As a reminder, a convex polygon is a polygon with all its interior angles less than 180^degrees. By using this definition, we figure out that every regular polygon is convex. If one angle has more than 180 degrees, the polygon is considered to be concave.
A convex hull uses the same principle as convex polygon applied to set of points. For instance, a convex hull is the smallest convex polygon containing all the points of a set.
One of the purpose of a convex hull is to prune a specific area in a plane. It is mostly used in computer graphics, geometry and navigation. One interesting use case of convex hull is presented in some papers presenting techniques to construct floorplans based on data collected from phone sensors. By using convex hull, we can prune a plan and focus only on the area containing the collected traces. Another interesting use-case is finding the farthest pair of points in a set in an efficient way. We will dive more into details in the next section when we will present some algorithms used to find convex hulls.</p>

<p>How to find a convex hull in set of points?
Many algorithms are widely used for finding convex hulls, each of them has strenghts and weaknesses as presented below.
<strong>Gift warping algorithm.</strong> Also known as the Jarvis March, It is one of the most popular and easiest algorithm for finding convex hulls. It works on a simple principle which consists in exploring the n points of a set and returning the list of the points surrounding the set in regard with the properties of a convex hull. This approach requires a O(nm) time complexity in the better case where n is the number of points explored and m is the number of points forming the shape of the hull. In the worst case where n = m, then the time complexity becomes O(n^2). This can easily be huge for a big dataset.
To compute a convex hull of a set of points using the Gift Warping Algorithm, we start with the leftmost point p_i (for i = 0) known to be in the convex hull. Then, we select another point p_i+1 such as all the points remaining are on the right of the line drawn between points p_i and p_i+1 and we repeat in loop until we reach the first point p_0.

<p>Alpha Shapes.</p>

<p>Every Alpha Shape is a convex hull, but not every convex hull is an alpha shape</p>
