I"G<p>The Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm is one of the most used algorithms to find similarities between two time series. Its goal is to find the optimal global alignment between two time series by exploiting temporal distortions between them. DTW algorithm has been first used to match signals in speech recognition. 
However, its scope of use is wider as it can be used in Time series of two-dimensional space to model trajectories. In the case of modeling and analyzing trajectories, the DTW algorithm stands out as a good way of computing similarity between trajectories.</p>
