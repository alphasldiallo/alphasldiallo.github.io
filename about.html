I am an IT professional with more than five years of experience in **consulting**, **software engineering**  and **project management**. I am currently doing a PhD in Information Systems from the [Distributed Object Programming Lab](http://doplab.unil.ch), at HEC Lausanne (Switzerland). My area of research is related to human mobility and distributed systems.

During the course of my master in Information Systems, I worked on indoor tracking systems by implementing a system with the same characteristics of GPS i.e balancing ubiquity, accuracy and cost. Prior to this experience, I led the development of a national portal of Investment for the Republic of Guinea and along with a team, made a mapping of the private sector as a consultant of a World Bank Project (IDA H 8670 â€“ GN).


My area of expertise ranges from collecting, analyzing and modeling location data as well as managing IT projects in controlled environments.
