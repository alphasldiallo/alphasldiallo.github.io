<p>I am a IT professional with more than five years of experience in consulting, software engineering and project management. I am currently doing a PhD in Information Systems from the Distributed Object Programming Lab, at HEC Lausanne (Switzerland). My area of research is related to human mobility and distributed systems.
During the course of my master in Information Systems, I worked on indoor tracking systems by implementing a system with the same characteristics of GPS i.e balancing ubiquity, accuracy and cost. Prior to this experience, I led the development of a national portal of Investment for the Republic of Guinea and along with a team, made a mapping of the private sector as a consultant of a World Bank Project (IDA H 8670 â€“ GN).
My area of expertise ranges from collecting, analyzing and modeling location data as well as managing IT projects in controlled environments.</p>
