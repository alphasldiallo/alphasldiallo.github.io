### Executive summary
I am an IT professional with more than six years of experience in **consulting**, **software engineering**  and **project management**. I am currently doing a PhD in Information Systems at the [Distributed Object Programming Lab](http://doplab.unil.ch) of HEC Lausanne (University of Lausanne - Switzerland). My area of research is related to human mobility and distributed systems.

During my master's in Information Systems, I worked on indoor tracking systems by implementing a system that balanced ubiquity, accuracy, and cost. Prior to this experience, I led the development of a national portal of Investment for the Republic of Guinea and, along with a team, made a mapping of the Guinean private sector as a consultant for a World Bank Project (IDA H 8670 – GN).


My area of expertise ranges from collecting, analyzing and modeling location data as well as managing IT projects in controlled environments.
